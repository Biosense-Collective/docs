# BFiVRC: BrainFlowsIntoVRChat

BFiVRC is a BrainFlow implementation of [bci-workshop](https://github.com/ChilloutCharles/bci-workshop) that sends your brain's relaxation and focus metrics, and power values based on the common frequency bands used in EEG measuements, for left, right and both sides of the head. Additional support for heart rate and respiration is available when supported by your hardware.

## Why BrainFlow?

The [BrainFlow](https://BrainFlow.org) library provides a uniform API that is device agnostic, allowing this implementation of my workshop fork to work for all [supported biosensors](https://BrainFlow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/SupportedBoards.html) (including the muse headbands). No extra software needed!
