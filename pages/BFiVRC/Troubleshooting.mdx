## Troubleshooting
- I have broken bluetooth adapter built into my pc and I would like to use a dongle instead. How can I connect my headband to that dongle?
  1. Disconnect the bluetooth dongle you want to use
  2. Search up 'device manager' on the start menu
  3. Find an entry for a bluetooth radio, right click on it and disable it
  4. Plug the new bluetooth dongle back in

- Muse Headband connects just fine but times out after a few seconds. Solution: Reset the headband
  1. Turn off the headband
  2. Press and hold the power button until it turns on. Keep pressing until the light changes.
  3. Reconnect.

- I've set up everything and made a new avatar, but its still not reacting
  - Reason: VRChat stores cached OSC parameters for your avatar that aren't updated when the avatar is updated with new parameters
  - Solution: Go to `C:\Users\<YOUR USERNAME HERE>\AppData\LocalLow\VRChat\VRChat\OSC` and delete all folders under it, then reload avatar
